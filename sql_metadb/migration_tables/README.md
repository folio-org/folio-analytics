Migration Tables for Metadb
===========================

These are transitional "migration tables" to assist with migration of
legacy LDP 1.x queries to Metadb.  They emulate LDP 1.x tables,
allowing LDP 1.x queries and derived tables to run in Metadb.

The tables are designed to be loaded into a Metadb database once every
evening, until all legacy queries have been migrated to use the new
Metadb tables.

The search_path should be set when loading the tables as:

```bash
psql -c 'set search_path = public' -f <sqlfile>
```

If you find an error in these tables, or if your installation of LDP
1.x has a column that has been omitted here, please [submit a pull
request](../CONTRIBUTING.md) with the correction/addition.

These tables are created using the same pattern as derived tables, and
with the following additional rules:

* Each table should emulate an existing table located in the `public`
  schema of a LDP 1.x database.
* Each table has only one "source table" in the `FROM` clause, which
  should be a Metadb table.  The source table should not end in `__t`
  or `__`.
* The first column is nearly always `id::varchar(36)`.
* The last column is nearly always `jsonb_pretty(jsonb)::json AS
  data`.
* All other columns are extracted from the `jsonb` column of the
  source table using `jsonb_extract_path_text()`.
* All columns extracted from `jsonb` should be simple data types from
  the top level of the JSON object; in other words, the same columns
  supported by LDP 1.x.
* Cast varchar columns to `varchar(65535)`, except for UUIDs (the
  field name ending in `Id`) which should be `varchar(36)`.
* Cast Boolean columns to `boolean`.
* Cast timestamps with time zone to `timestamptz`.
* Cast numeric values used in finance to `numeric(12,2)`.
* Create an index on each column, except for `id` and `data`.
* Define the `id` column as a primary key using: `ALTER TABLE
  <tablename> ADD PRIMARY KEY (id);`.
* SQL files are added to runlist.txt in alphabetical order rather than
  in dependency order (since there are no dependencies).

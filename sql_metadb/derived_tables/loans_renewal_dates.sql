--metadb:table loans_renewal_dates

-- This derived table captures the renewal actions from the
-- folio_circulation.audit_loan table and shows the dates of renewal.
-- The table also captures the current loan status from the
-- folio_circulation.loan table.  This table may be used to count the
-- number of renewals within a given renewal date range, or count the
-- number of renewals for specific loans.  The folio_renewal_count is
-- the number of times the loan has been renewed in FOLIO.

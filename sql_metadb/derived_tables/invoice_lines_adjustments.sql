--metadb:table invoice_lines_adjustments

-- This table includes the extracted adjustments data on the invoice
-- line level.  The field description can be locally defined by
-- institutions.  Examples are "shipping", "VAT" (MwSt), "Service
-- Charge".  The adjustment fund distribution data array will be
-- extracted from the invoice_lines table in a separate derived table
-- called invoice_lines_adjustments_fund_distributions in a future
-- release.

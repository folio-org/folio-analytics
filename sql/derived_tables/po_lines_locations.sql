-- This query creates a derived table for purchase order line
-- locations including location quantity and type.  It uses
-- conditional statements to search for location ID and location name
-- in the purchase order line location and holdings location fields,
-- displays whichever is not null, and indicates the source of the
-- resulting location data (purchase order location or purchase order
-- holding location) in the pol_location_source column.

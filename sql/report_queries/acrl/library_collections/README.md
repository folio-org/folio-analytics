## Status
This READMe refers ACRL reporters to the following four queries which were created earlier. These queries can be adapted for this particular need, and for local reporting situations.
* Title Count (for physical titles cataloged in Inventory)
* Item Count  (for physical volumes cataloged in Inventory)
* ERM Title count (If using ERM - for electronic items tracked in the ERM, which is still in development)
* ERM Inventory Title Count  (for electronic items cataloged in Inventory)

## Purpose
These queries can be used by ACRL member libraries to report on library collections cataloged or tracked through the FOLIO Inventory and/or Folio ERM (currently in development) for ACRL’s annual Academic Library Trends and Statistics Survey.

ACRL requires seven collection title counts, and one collection item count:
* Title counts:
  * Physical book titles
  * Physical serial titles (doesn’t matter if current/ceased or currently received or not; in all formats)
  * Physical media titles
  * Electronic book titles
  * Electronic serial titles (doesn’t matter if current/ceased or currently received or not; in all formats)
  * Electronic media titles
  * Electronic database titles
* Item count:
  * Physical volumes (text-based volumes)

The four queries noted above provide title or item counts by format. Among other elements, they include the most common FOLIO elements used to describe formats; reporters will likely need to add and/or remove elements to suit their local needs, and may need to write additional queries.  Where possible, they allow you to type text into “parameter filters” to help get the needed format breakouts. See the format filter section below.  Each institution’s reporters need to know how their institution tracks the metadata need to get the requested breakouts. 

You can run the queries multiple times to get individual counts.  Alternatively, you may be able to run a query one time, splitting up the title counts with all relevant format measures.

**Please also note for the title counts:** 
Generally, the goal is to count unique instance records by format. Needed format information will be either on the instance and/or the holdings records.  We have not tested this fully, but it is advised that if you want unique title counts, that if you are using data on the holdings record, you filter on that data only, and not include it in the grouping display. Otherwise, if you include holdings fields that may not be unique to the instance record, (e.g., there are multiple locations at the institution, there are multiple copies within a specific library or across a campus, there are different holdings types, etc.) the title count will be increased to reflect the counts that are unique across the instance and holdings records.

## FILTERS
As mentioned earlier, four main queries can be used to help institution answering the Library Collections data and many filters can be selected.
1. [Title Count](https://github.com/NancyBolduc/folio-analytics/tree/master/sql/report_queries/title_count)
2. [Item Count (Volume count)](https://github.com/NancyBolduc/folio-analytics/tree/master/sql/report_queries/item_count)
3. ERM Title Count (If using ERM; targeted for Release 1.1 but relies on the next version of LDP (MetaDB)) 
4. [ERM Inventory Title Count](https://github.com/NancyBolduc/folio-analytics/tree/master/sql/report_queries/erm/count)

  <summary>Click for information on Hardcoded and Parameter filters!</summary>

### Hardcoded filters:
Note that the first two queries exclude online resources via their hardcoded filters (i.e., not instance.format_name (computer – online resource) and not holdings.library_name (online)). The fourth limits items in the Inventory to online resources via its hard filters (i.e., in instance.format_name (computer – online resource) and in holdings.library_name (online)).  All queries exclude records that are suppressed.

### Parameter filters:
(Note that the FOLIO App “Settings” for Inventory may allow you to see what possible values many of these fields may contain at your institution.)

#### Non-format filters:
* ACRL requests that unpurchased PDA/DDA items be excluded.  How they are tracked may differ by library.  We know one library is considering excluding them through the instance status element.
* Libraries may need to include/exclude titles by location.

#### Format filters:
The table below help reporters by indicating which query to use and which format filters to select to get the desired count. In the left-hand column of the table below, is a list of the counts needed for the survey. The second column provides guidance on how you could use filters to get to the desired format counts using the existing queries. Please know that the filters chosen may be different from one institution to another and the lists provided are suggestions based on the data currently available to report writers. It may well change as new developments are rolled out.

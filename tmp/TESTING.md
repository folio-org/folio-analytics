Query Testing
=============


A lightweight testing framework is provided in this repository for
testing queries.


System requirements
-------------------

* Linux or macOS
* [Go](https://golang.org) 1.13 or later
* Database systems supported:
  * PostgreSQL 12 or later
    ([Debian](https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Apt),
    [CentOS/RHEL](https://yum.postgresql.org/))
  * PostgreSQL 9 or later may also work
  * Redshift 1.0.8995 or later


Configuration
-------------

First set the `GOPATH` environment variable to specify a path that can
serve as the build workspace for Go, e.g.:

```shell
$ export GOPATH=$HOME/go
```

Then set `GO111MODULE` to `on` to enable Go dependency management:

```shell
$ export GO111MODULE=on
```

Next create a configuration file called `.ldptestsql` in your home
directory.  This file provides connection details for the database to
be used for testing:

```ini
databases = <section_name>,...

[<section_name>]
dbtype = <database_type>
host = <host_name>
port = <port_number>
user = <user_name>
password = <password>
dbname = <database_name>
```

For example:

```ini
databases = ldpqdev,redshift_ldpqdev

[ldpqdev]
dbtype = postgresql
host = localhost
port = 5432
user = ldp
password = YS4p4EkJGWJqbO9w
dbname = ldpqdev

[redshift_ldpqdev]
dbtype = redshift
host = ldpqdev.hfwgaxcbvs5t.us-east-2.redshift.amazonaws.com
port = 5439
user = ldp
password = z3HjUZhkSaQPdt43
dbname = ldpqqev
```


Running tests
-------------

To run tests that have been created for a specific query or queries in
a directory, `cd` to that directory and then run `go test`, e.g.:

```shell
$ cd folio-analytics/sql/circ_detail
$ go test
```

To run all tests, change to the top level directory:

```shell
$ cd folio-analytics
$ go test -count=1 ./...
```


Creating a new test
-------------------

To create a new test for a query, first run the query against a
database that contains the test data provided in
`folio-analytics/testdata/`.  For this example we will run the query
`folio-analytics/circ_detail/circ_detail.sql` and capture the result
in a file called `circ_detail_result.csv`:

```shell
$ psql ldpqdev -U ldp --csv -f circ_detail.sql -o circ_detail_result.csv
```

The result file `circ_detail_result.csv` should be stored in the same
directory as the query.  The `--csv` flag specifies that the result
should be in CSV format.

Next we create the test code in a file which also should be stored in
the same directory, and which should have a file name ending in
`_test.go`.  In our example, since we are testing `circ_detail.sql`,
we create a file called `circ_detail_test.go`.  Its contents should
look roughly like, e.g.:

```go
package circ_detail

import (
	"testing"

	"github.com/folio-org/folio-analytics/gotest"
)

func TestQuery(t *testing.T) {

	gotest.RunTest(t, "circ_detail.sql", "circ_detail_result.csv")

}
```

Note the first line: `package circ_detail`.  The package name should
match the name of the directory where this file (and the query and
result) are located.

The test is run by the line:

```go
	gotest.RunTest(t, "circ_detail.sql", "circ_detail_result.csv")
```

The first file, in this example `"circ_detail.sql"`, should contain
the query to be tested.  The second file, `"circ_detail_result.csv"`,
should contain the expected result in CSV format.

The testing code called by `gotest.RunTest()` will run the query in
`circ_detail.sql` and confirm that the result matches the expected
result in `circ_detail_result.csv`.
